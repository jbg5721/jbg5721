        <h2>Reflection on building a website with HTML and CSS vs. building a website on Wordpress</h2>
        
        
        <p class ="tab">There was a lot to learn when building a website on both Penn State Wordpress as well as coding a website. I found positives and negatives to both methods of website creation. For reference here is a link to my portfolio site on Wordpress: <a href ="https://sites.psu.edu/jbg5721/" target="_blank">Joey Gardiner Wordpress Profile</a></p>
        <p class ="tab">There are a few notable challenges as a new learner I find with Wordpress as well as coding a website. With Penn State Wordpress I found the editor layout to take time to get used to and navigate through. One example I can think of is with the home page. By default the home page is set to display posts like a blog page. I wanted to change this so that the home page would display as a static page instead. With the help of my professor, Doctor Elisa E. Beshero-Bondar, we found out how to change it to a static page. With coding a website the most difficult part is learning the basic code for it and troubleshooting errors. Unlike Wordpress, you of course have to create all the code yourself and organize it in a way that will be easy to come back to. This was a problem I had as I had CSS code in my HTML files, CSS code in my CSS file, and it got hard to look at. </p>
        <p class ="tab">They also have their own clear advantages. I find that with Wordpress, after you learn your way around, you can create and finish a website very quickly. This would be helpful if you wanted to create a quick web page for an event. Wordpress is a convenient way of website creation by easily bypassing the learning code and troubleshooting phase. With coding a website you get basically unlimited customizability. I can design the website how I want it to look and I feel like I have more control. Coding a website also feels much more personal. It is something that you created and it is your own website.</p>
        <p class ="tab">There can be a few challenges to modifying the layout and organization of each site. One major one for Penn State Wordpress is finding the setting for changing appearances. There are a multitude of different pages, with drop downs and links that will lead you to another menu space, and it can be easy to lose track of where you looked already and where you haven’t yet. For coding a website, I feel that one of the most challenging parts is spacing. Figuring out how to get margins, paragraph indents, a new paragraph can take longer then you might think.</p>
        <p class ="tab">The skills necessary to learn and develop these sites are not all that different. There are a few separate skills that you don’t exactly need for the other. A general experience with computers is important for both. I find it important to be able to figure out what went wrong and how it went wrong for both applications. One skill that isn’t as important for Wordpress but is vital for coding is file management and command terminals. File management allows you to easily find out where you put your website files and how to access them. Being able to use command terminals allows you to push your website files to the web as a presenting website, as well as lets you move through your computer's files without using the file explorer GUI. </p>
        <p class="tab">There are a variety of things I would like to learn about website coding. I would like to learn about the different options to the styling options in CSS. I heard that JavaScript can be used in websites and I think it would be neat to learn how to use that as well. I believe JavaScript can be used in creating little animations which would be fun to work with.</p>
