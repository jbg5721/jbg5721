        <h2>Digit 100, Intro to Digital Humanities</h2>
        <p class ="tab">I took this course in the Spring semester of 2021, of my Sophomore year. In this course I learned how to create this website! I also learned how to use Penn State Wordpress. This is a link to my portfolio site on Wordpress: <a href ="https://sites.psu.edu/jbg5721/" target="_blank">Joey Gardiner Wordpress Profile</a></p>
        <h3>Reflection on building a website with HTML and CSS vs. building a website on Wordpress</h3>
        <p class ="tab">There are a few notable challenges as a new learner I find with Wordpress and coding a website. With Wordpress I found the editor layout to take time to get used to and navigate through. With coding a website the most difficult part is learning the basic code for it and trouble shooting errors. They also have their own clear advantages. I find that with Wordpress, after you learn your way around, you can create and finish a website very quickly. This would be helpful if you wanted to create a quick webpage for an event. With coding a website you get basically unlimited customability. I can design the website how I want it to look and I feel like I have more control.</p>

        <h2>Photo 100, Introduction to Photography</h2>
        <p class ="tab"> I took this course in the Fall 2020 Semester, of my Sophomore year. In this course I learned and practiced the concepts of Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom, and photography. With the two house examples I practiced using the clone stamp tool to correct blemishes in the original photo. In the second set of photos, the Runner, I practiced selecting parts of a photo, creating new layers with the selection and then editing the selection. I can select the shirt and the headband seperately and move them onto different layers. Then I can go into the color settings and change the grey into the desired color. With the VNet building I practiced the clone stamp tool, brush tool, as well as different ways to use the text tool. I used the text tool to type the words and then I created a shadow behind the text. Using the brush tool, I could create the illusion that I made 3D text.</p>
        <p class ="tab">The last 3 photos are some that I took myself and edited the contrast and saturation using Adobe Lightroom.</p>

           <h2>Art 168, Intro to Digital Media</h2>
           <p class ="tab">I took this course in the Fall 2019 semester, of my freshman year. In this class, I learned about Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe After Effects. While I recognize that these are the not highest quality videos, they still display a variety of different and interesting skills. For the first video, I created 4 shorter videos to display a variety of skills such as: parenting objects and shapes, moving still images, motion tracking with a green screen, moving digital cameras, and many more.</p>
           <p class ="tab">In the second video, I used a 360 camera in a cardboard and paper scene to create a 3-dimensional space. I was then able to animate onto this 3D space and with youtube, a viewer can orbit around and look around the scene. The final video is a short movie of a character having a nightmare and then at the end of the video the nightmare repeats into real life.</p>
