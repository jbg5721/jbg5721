      <h2>Digit 100, Intro to Digital Humanities</h2>
      <p class ="tab">I took this course in the Spring semester of 2021, of my Sophomore year. In this course I learned how to create this website! I also learned how to use Penn State Wordpress. This is a link to my portfolio site on Wordpress: <a href ="https://sites.psu.edu/jbg5721/" target="_blank">Joey Gardiner Wordpress Profile</a> </p>
      <p class ="tab">Another program we used in class is a web browser extension called, Hypothesis. This extension allows you to annotate on articles on the public web. Other users with this extension can view and react to your annotation.</p>

      <h2>Photo 100, Introduction to Photography</h2>
      <p class ="tab"> I took this course in the Fall 2020 Semester, of my Sophomore year. In this course I learned and practiced the concepts of Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom, and photography. With the two house examples I practiced using the clone stamp tool to correct blemishes in the original photo. In the second set of photos, the Runner, I practiced selecting parts of a photo, creating new layers with the selection and then editing the selection. I can select the shirt and the headband separately and move them onto different layers. Then I can go into the color settings and change the grey into the desired color. With the VNet building I practiced the clone stamp tool, brush tool, as well as different ways to use the text tool. I used the text tool to type the words and then I created a shadow behind the text. Using the brush tool, I could create the illusion that I made 3D text.</p>
      <p class ="tab">The last 3 photos are some that I took myself and edited the contrast and saturation using Adobe Lightroom.</p>

        <h2>Art 168, Intro to Digital Media</h2>
        <p class ="tab">I took this course in the Fall 2019 semester of my freshman year. In this class, I learned about Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe After Effects. While I recognize that these are not the highest quality videos, they still display a variety of different and interesting skills. For the first video, I created 4 shorter videos to display a variety of skills such as: parenting objects and shapes, moving still images, motion tracking with a green screen, moving digital cameras, and many more.</p>
        <p class ="tab">In the second video, I used a 360 camera in a cardboard and paper scene to create a 3-dimensional space. I was then able to animate onto this 3D space and with youtube, a viewer can orbit around and look around the scene. The final video is a short movie of a character having a nightmare and then at the end of the video the nightmare repeats into real life.</p>

        <h2>Personal Works</h2>
        <p class ="tab">Below is a gallery of some of my personal digital works. I created these using Procreate, a digital drawing app. I used different brushes, layers, and colors to create these. Some like the concept drawing, were less about the technique and more so about creating an interesting character design that could stand out.  </p>
