      <h2>Digit 110, Text Encoding</h2>
      <p class="tab">I took this course in my junior year, the fall of 2021. I learned all about XML, TEI, and XSLT coding in this course. Our main focus was transcribing hand written documents into XML or TEI code. Using XSLT we could transform the XML or TEI code into HTML for websites! I worked with a group to produce the website below. We were interested in the type of information we could find on Warren Behrend based on the last letters he wrote before his unfortunate death in December 1929. </p>

      <h2>Dart 314, Video Art</h2>
      <p class="tab">I took this course in my junior year, the fall of 2021. This course taught me about using film equipment and the production needed to make video art. Throughout the course I learned how to use the Blackmagic 4k film camera, the RED Dragon 6k film camera, lights, greenscreens, and the post-production. </p>

      <h2>Photo 100, Introduction to Photography</h2>
      <p class ="tab"> I took this course in the Fall 2020 Semester, of my Sophomore year. In this course I learned and practiced the concepts of Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom, and photography. With the two house examples I practiced using the clone stamp tool to correct blemishes in the original photo. In the second set of photos, the Runner, I practiced selecting parts of a photo, creating new layers with the selection and then editing the selection. I can select the shirt and the headband separately and move them onto different layers. Then I can go into the color settings and change the grey into the desired color. With the VNet building I practiced the clone stamp tool, brush tool, as well as different ways to use the text tool. I used the text tool to type the words and then I created a shadow behind the text. Using the brush tool, I could create the illusion that I made 3D text.</p>
      <p class ="tab">The last 3 photos are some that I took myself and edited the contrast and saturation using Adobe Lightroom.</p>

        <h2>Art 168, Intro to Digital Media</h2>
        <p class ="tab">I took this course in the Fall 2019 semester of my freshman year. In this class, I learned about Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe After Effects. While I recognize that these are not the highest quality videos, they still display a variety of different and interesting skills. For the first video, I created 4 shorter videos to display a variety of skills such as: parenting objects and shapes, moving still images, motion tracking with a green screen, moving digital cameras, and many more.</p>
        <p class ="tab">In the second video, I used a 360 camera in a cardboard and paper scene to create a 3-dimensional space. I was then able to animate onto this 3D space and with youtube, a viewer can orbit around and look around the scene. The final video is a short movie of a character having a nightmare and then at the end of the video the nightmare repeats into real life.</p>
