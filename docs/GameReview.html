        <h2>Sol Traveler</h2>
        <p class="tab">Sol Traveler is a short space themed indie video game. You find yourself stranded on a ship in deep space. Your one goal is to pilot the ship back to Earth. The ship itself is not very large, it has a total of three rooms that you can access. Despite that small number of rooms there are a lot of things you can interact with.</p>

        <p class="tab">You can interact with books, alien food, and various buttons on the ship. You do not need to eat the food but you can. There are two buttons that dispense food when pressed. One button dispenses a drink container and the other dispenses an alien mushroom and an alien orb. To control the ship there are 6 total levers. In the main control room there are 4 of these levers. There are two levers to rotate the ship left or right. The other two levers turn the ship left or right. In the back of the ship there are two more levers. These control the thrusters.</p>
