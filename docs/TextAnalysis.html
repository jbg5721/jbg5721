        <h3>Looking at and comparing 2 large texts: <i>Star Wars, A New Hope</i> and <i>Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back</i></h3>
        <p class ="tab">
            Starting off with <i>A New Hope</i> in Voyant tools I noticed that there were a lot of mentions of non character terms. Words such as Death and Cockpit had 229 and 196 mentions respectively. I can see this making sense as they are trying to destroy the Death Star in this movie. To do that they of course need to get in a ship's cockpit to fly it into space. Star though, is mentioned 4 times less then Death is at 225. This has me curious to what the other 4 mentions of death were. 
            I went and found the mentions of Death, here they are:
            
        </p>
        <ul class ="tab">
            <li>"A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon."</li>
            <li>"The room is grim after Red Leader's death."</li>
            <li>"Gold Five, a veteran of countless campaigns, spins toward his death."</li>
            <li>"Luke is stunned by Biggs' death."</li>
        </ul>
        <p class ="tab">Three of these I am not really surprised to see, they are mentioning the death of 3 rebel pilots. The one mention of Death I find interesting though. It was used to describe the expansive deserts of Tatooine. I honestly like this description a lot because it feels very accurate to what you see in the movie.
            Luke was mentioned the most at 617 times. This makes sense as he is the main character. 
        </p>
        <p class ="tab">There are three specific words that caught my eye as they appeared to be errors; Int, Ext, Cont’d. After searching through the text I found that these are script directions. Int is interior ext is exterior, and cont’d is continued. Int appears 314 times and Ext appears 167 times throughout the script. They are often inside of something, whether it be a starship or a structure so Int is used much more then Ext.</p>

        <p class = "tab">Using Voyant tools on <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> script, I noticed that there were quite a few more character names being mentioned compared to <i>A New Hope</i>. The top four mentioned words in this text are Luke, Han, Leia, Threepio. These are all characters which are different from <i>A New Hope</i>. A New Hope had 2 character names and 2 other words in the top four. Those being Int and Death. I find it interesting that if I look at the rest of the top 10 most common words in <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> there are only 3 mentions of non character words. Those being Int, Falcon, Ext. Int and Ext I am not surprised to see there. Falcon I find interesting that it was mentioned that much, 154 times to be exact. Falcon is of course referring to the Millenium Falcon, which brings me to my next point.
        </p>
        <p class = "tab">Millennium was used a lot less then Falcon was. As mentioned Falcon was used 154 times, but Millennium was used only 99 times. I figured this was because the characters were shortening the name every now and then so I looked into it. I was correct on thinking that but I found something else. Screen descriptions also refer to the Millennium Falcon as just Falcon as well. Here is an example:
        </p>
        <ul class ="tab">
            <li>The Falcon turns into the asteroid storm and as the ship completes its turn, asteroids start coming straight at the cockpit windows.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class ="tab">
            Looking at both of the scripts I got curious about where Int and Ext appeared the most throughout the text. I found that <i>A New Hope</i> slowly rises in usage of both Int and Ext. At the start both were used little. Int continued to rise and peaked near the end of the movie. On the other hand Ext dropped to zero usages around mid way through and jumped up to a peak of its own at the very end. I thought this was interesting because I would think that the usage of Int and Ext would be mirrored. The more characters are inside, the less they are outside but it turns out I was wrong. What this actually means is that in the beginning of the movie the characters stayed in one place for longer periods of time. Comparing this to the second half of the movie where characters would be moving between interior and exterior settings very often. This is similar in <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>, except for one thing. In this movie characters are moving around between settings quite often in the beginning and the ending of the movie. Around the middle of the movie Int and Ext drop in usage.
