        <h3>Looking at and comparing 2 large texts: <i>Star Wars, A New Hope</i> and <i>Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back</i></h3>
        <p class ="tab">
            Starting off with <i>A New Hope</i> in Voyant tools I noticed that there were a lot of mentions of non character terms. Words such as Death and Cockpit had 229 and 196 mentions respectively. I can see this making sense as they are trying to destroy the Death Star in this movie. To do that they of course need to get in a ship's cockpit to fly it into space. Star though, is mentioned 4 times less then Death is at 225. This has me curious to what the other 4 mentions of death were. 
            I went and found the mentions of Death, here they are:
            
        </p>
        <ul class ="tab">
            <li>"A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon."</li>
            <li>"The room is grim after Red Leader's death."</li>
            <li>"Gold Five, a veteran of countless campaigns, spins toward his death."</li>
            <li>"Luke is stunned by Biggs' death."</li>
        </ul>
        <p class ="tab">Three of these I am not really surprised to see, they are mentioning the death of 3 rebel pilots. The one mention of Death I find interesting though. It was used to describe the expansive deserts of Tatooine. I honestly like this description a lot because it feels very accurate to what you see in the movie.
            Luke was mentioned the most at 617 times. This makes sense as he is the main character. 
        </p>
        <p class ="tab">There are three specific words that caught my eye as they appeared to be errors; Int, Ext, Cont’d. After searching through the text I found that these are script directions. Int is interior ext is exterior, and cont’d is continued. Int appears 314 times and Ext appears 167 times throughout the script. They are often inside of something, whether it be a starship or a structure so Int is used much more then Ext.</p>

        </figure>
        
        <p class = "tab">Using Voyant tools on <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> script, I noticed that there were quite a few more character names being mentioned compared to <i>A New Hope</i>. The top four mentioned words in this text are Luke, Han, Leia, Threepio. These are all characters which are different from <i>A New Hope</i>. A New Hope had 2 character names and 2 other words in the top four. Those being Int and Death. I find it interesting that if I look at the rest of the top 10 most common words in <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> there are only 3 mentions of non character words. Those being Int, Falcon, Ext. Int and Ext I am not surprised to see there. Falcon I find interesting that it was mentioned that much, 154 times to be exact. Falcon is of course referring to the Millenium Falcon, which brings me to my next point.
        </p>
        <p class = "tab">Millennium was used a lot less then Falcon was. As mentioned Falcon was used 154 times, but Millennium was used only 99 times. I figured this was because the characters were shortening the name every now and then so I looked into it. I was correct on thinking that but I found something else. Screen descriptions also refer to the Millennium Falcon as just Falcon as well. Here is an example:
        </p>
        <ul class ="tab">
            <li>The Falcon turns into the asteroid storm and as the ship completes its turn, asteroids start coming straight at the cockpit windows.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class ="tab">
            Looking at both of the scripts I got curious about where Int and Ext appeared the most throughout the text. I found that <i>A New Hope</i> slowly rises in usage of both Int and Ext. At the start both were used little. Int continued to rise and peaked near the end of the movie. On the other hand Ext dropped to zero usages around mid way through and jumped up to a peak of its own at the very end. I thought this was interesting because I would think that the usage of Int and Ext would be mirrored. The more characters are inside, the less they are outside but it turns out I was wrong. What this actually means is that in the beginning of the movie the characters stayed in one place for longer periods of time. Comparing this to the second half of the movie where characters would be moving between interior and exterior settings very often. This is similar in <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>, except for one thing. In this movie characters are moving around between settings quite often in the beginning and the ending of the movie. Around the middle of the movie Int and Ext drop in usage.

        <p class ="tab">Moving over to AntConc, a text analysis tool, I started off looking at <i>A New Hope</i>. I started with a minimum of 3 N-Grams and a maximum of 5 N-Grams. The most common N-Gram is no surprise, “the death star”. The death star is no longer in <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> so I will be skipping over it. I am more interested in “surface of the” that appeared 37 times, and “out of the” that appeared 29 times. </p>
        <figure>

        </figure>
        <p class ="tab">First I will look at “surface of the” and see what type of context it is usually used in. When looking at the context I discovered that all but two of the mentions talk about the surface of the death star. Although one of the other mentions, are talking about the death star but under a different name. This line goes like this: “pulls out to skim the surface of the huge station”. So that really just leaves one usage of “surface of the” with no mentions of the death star. This last usage goes like this: “The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the planet Tatooine.”</p>
        <p class ="tab">Next looking at “out of the”, I was surprised to only see it in the text 29 times. The context results were quite varied however. There were many unique words such as cantina, oil, pirateship, sand, and speeder.</p>

        <p class ="tab">After <i>A New Hope</i> I moved over to looking at <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>. I again did a minimum of 3 N-Grams and a maximum of 5 N-Grams. I find it interesting that in the top 6 there are 4 N-Grams with millennium falcon in them. Another interesting N-Gram I see is “luke into comlink”. I wouldn’t have expected to see specifically Luke talking into comlinks that often throughout the movie. This was mentioned 19 times throughout the text. Originally I thought that there would be a lot of terms related to the Hoth scenes but I only see one N-Gram, that being “s snowspeeder rogue” with  24 appearances. The cloud city scene actually made a more common appearance. It was in the script 26 times with the N-Gram “int cloud city.”

        </figure>
        <p class ="tab">I wanted to compare the appearances of “surface of the” and “out of the” from <i>A New Hope</i> to <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>. The first of the two I found a striking difference immediately. “Surface of the” only has 8 appearances in <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>. When looking at the context, you find that “surface of the” technically has only four usages in total. This is drastically different from <i>A New Hope</i>‘s 37 usages of it. The second N-Gram of the two is actually quite similar, it has 22 appearances. This as well has some interesting and unique words. A few examples include elevator, gorge, vat, and cabin.</p>
