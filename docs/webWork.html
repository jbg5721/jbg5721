    <h2>Digit 110, Text Encoding</h2>
      <p class="tab">I took this course in my junior year, the fall of 2021. I learned all about XML, TEI, and XSLT coding in this course. Our main focus was transcribing hand written documents into XML or TEI code. Using XSLT we could transform the XML or TEI code into HTML for websites! I worked with a group to produce the website below. We were interested in the type of information we could find on Warren Behrend based on the last letters he wrote before his unfortunate death in December 1929. </p>
