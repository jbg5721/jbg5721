        <h2>Reflection on building a website with HTML and CSS vs. building a website on Wordpress</h2>
        <p class ="tab">There are a few notable challenges as a new learner I find with Wordpress and coding a website. With Wordpress I found the editor layout to take time to get used to and navigate through. With coding a website the most difficult part is learning the basic code for it and trouble shooting errors. They also have their own clear advantages. I find that with Wordpress, after you learn your way around, you can create and finish a website very quickly. This would be helpful if you wanted to create a quick webpage for an event. With coding a website you get basically unlimited customability. I can design the website how I want it to look and I feel like I have more control.</p>
